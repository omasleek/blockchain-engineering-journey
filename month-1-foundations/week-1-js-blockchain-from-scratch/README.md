# Week 1: JavaScript Blockchain From Scratch

## Overview
In this week, we build a **blockchain from scratch using pure JavaScript**.  
The goal is to understand how blockchains work internally before touching smart contracts or Web3 frameworks.

This week focuses on **core blockchain concepts**, not tools.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, I will be able to:
- Explain what a blockchain is in simple terms
- Create a block using JavaScript
- Link blocks together into a chain
- Understand hashing and immutability
- Detect when data has been tampered with

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1: Understanding a Block
- What a block is
- Properties of a block
- Creating a block using JavaScript

### Day 2: Cryptographic Hashing
- What hashing means
- Why SHA-256 is used
- Making blocks tamper-proof

### Day 3: Building the Blockchain
- Linking blocks together
- Genesis block
- Chain structure

### Day 4: Validation & Immutability
- Detecting changes in blocks
- Why blockchains are trusted

### Day 5: Mining & Proof of Work (Conceptual)
- Why mining exists
- Difficulty and nonce
- Real-world mining analogy

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Crypto concepts (SHA-256)

## Outcome
At the end of this week, this folder will contain a **fully working mini blockchain** built without any frameworks.

This forms the foundation for smart contracts and Web3 development.
