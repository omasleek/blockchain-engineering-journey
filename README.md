# 🚀 Blockchain Engineering Journey (6-Month Intensive)

## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my **6-month, hands-on journey into blockchain engineering**, focused on building **production-grade decentralized systems** from the ground up.

Rather than following tutorials, each project is designed to simulate **real-world blockchain engineering experience**, emphasizing:

- Smart contract architecture
- Security-first thinking
- Gas optimization
- Scalability and maintainability

The goal is to develop the depth and mindset of a **professional blockchain developer** through consistent building, testing, breaking, and documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master Solidity and smart contract engineering
- Build real DeFi protocols (staking, AMMs, lending)
- Develop full-stack Web3 applications
- Understand blockchain security and common exploits
- Learn Layer-2 scaling, oracles, and DAO governance
- Build a strong, professional GitHub portfolio

## 🔐 Security Philosophy
Security is treated as a **first-class concern**.

Some projects intentionally include vulnerable contracts to understand:
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflows
- Flash-loan exploits
- Front-running & MEV risks

Mitigations and lessons learned are documented within each project.

## 📈 Learning Philosophy

> **Build it.**  
> **Break it.**  
> **Secure it.**  
> **Optimize it.**  
> **Document it.**

This repository emphasizes **engineering judgment**, not just code output.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
All projects are for **educational and portfolio purposes only** and have not been professionally audited.  
They should **not** be used in production without proper security review.
